# [Project 1: Exploring Lending Club Loan Default Rates](https://github.com/soltaniehha/Business-Analytics-Toolbox/blob/master/docs/team-projects/Summer-2021/B2-Team7-Exploring-Lending-Club-Loan-Default-Rates.ipynb)
* Background: Lending Club (the Club), founded in 2007, is a firm that offers members a broad range of financial instruments to achieve their goals. Personal loans ranging from 500 to 40,000 are the primary product that the Club provides. Many of these loans are facilitated via peer-to-peer transactions, though as the Club has expanded into other markets such as banking, the need for peer-funded transactions has declined. The dataset used for this research project is a sample of 780k peer-to-peer personal loans originated between 2007 and 2020 Q3. The dataset includes loan details such as loan amount, interest rate, and amortization term; as well as borrower financial details such as credit rating score, debt-to-income ratios, and annual income.

* Objective: This research will explore loan distribution and how different loan and borrower characteristics impact the likelihood of default on a personal loan.

# [Project 2: Predicting Future Bike Demand in Seoul](https://github.com/Sihoon-Daniel/Past_Projects/blob/main/02-Predicting-Seoul-Bike-Demand/A-Team5-Predicting-Seoul-Bike-Demand.ipynb)

* Objective: The goal is to use the Seoul Bike Rental database to predict future bike demand based on attributes such as seasons, the weather conditions, and the number of bikes rented per hour. The bikes are are rented out by app based companies such as Seoul Bike.
* Method: Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear & Ridge Regression, Feature Engineering

# [Project 3: Predicting Income level- classification ML](https://github.com/Sihoon-Daniel/Past_Projects/tree/main/03-Predicting-Income-Classification)

* Objective: To predict whether the person will earn more than $50K per year or less based on information of an individual (age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, gender, hours of work, etc...)
* Methods: Boosting, Random Forest, Lasso & Ridge Regression, Decision Tree

# [Project 4:Effect of Section time on Attendance](https://github.com/Sihoon-Daniel/Past_Projects/tree/main/04-Attendance-and-Section-Time)

* Objective: The aim of this experiment is to observe if there is any difference in class attendance depending on morning and afternoon cohorts.
* MeThods: A/B Testing, Linear Regression with Covariates, fixed effects, and heterogeneity

# [Project 5: Predicting Obesity](https://github.com/Sihoon-Daniel/Past_Projects/blob/main/05-Predicting-Obesity/Predicting%20Obesity.ipynb)

* Objective: This study is motivated by the goal of understanding obesity better, identifying high risk individuals and creating appropriate outreach and wellbeing programs for disease intervention. In this project , we are going to analyze obesity and discover its impact factors from age, family history, eating habits, alcohol consumption, smoking, etc.
* Methods: KNN, PCA, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
