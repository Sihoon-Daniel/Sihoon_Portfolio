# [Project 1: Exploring Lending Club Loan Default Rates](https://github.com/soltaniehha/Business-Analytics-Toolbox/blob/master/docs/team-projects/Summer-2021/B2-Team7-Exploring-Lending-Club-Loan-Default-Rates.ipynb)
* Background: Lending Club (the Club), founded in 2007, is a firm that offers members a broad range of financial instruments to achieve their goals. Personal loans ranging from 500 to 40,000 are the primary product that the Club provides. Many of these loans are facilitated via peer-to-peer transactions, though as the Club has expanded into other markets such as banking, the need for peer-funded transactions has declined. The dataset used for this research project is a sample of 780k peer-to-peer personal loans originated between 2007 and 2020 Q3. The dataset includes loan details such as loan amount, interest rate, and amortization term; as well as borrower financial details such as credit rating score, debt-to-income ratios, and annual income.

* Objective: Objective: This research will explore loan distribution and how different loan and borrower characteristics impact the likelihood of default on a personal loan.
