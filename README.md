# [Project 2: Predicting Future Bike Demand in Seoul](https://github.com/Sihoon-Daniel/Past_Projects/blob/main/02-Predicting-Seoul-Bike-Demand/A-Team5-Predicting-Seoul-Bike-Demand.ipynb)

* Objective: The goal is to use the Seoul Bike Rental database to predict future bike demand based on attributes such as seasons, the weather conditions, and the number of bikes rented per hour. The bikes are are rented out by app based companies such as Seoul Bike.
* Method: Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear & Ridge Regression, Feature Engineering

# [Project 5: Predicting Obesity](https://github.com/Sihoon-Daniel/Past_Projects/blob/main/05-Predicting-Obesity/Predicting%20Obesity.ipynb)

* Objective: This study is motivated by the goal of understanding obesity better, identifying high risk individuals and creating appropriate outreach and wellbeing programs for disease intervention. In this project , we are going to analyze obesity and discover its impact factors from age, family history, eating habits, alcohol consumption, smoking, etc.
* Methods: KNN, PCA, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
